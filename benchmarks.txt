Getting better performance with channels last compared to channels first (also get GPU utilof 50% vs 85%)
Base-channels-last seems to work best, no advantage to self-compiling the build

Note that to compile with NKL, need to have libmklml.so
- Clone https://github.com/01org/mkl-dnn
- In the cloned repo, run
cd scripts && ./prepare_mkl.sh && cd ..
- Add the libraries to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/ashutosh/mkl-dnn/external/mklml_lnx_2018.0.20170720/lib
